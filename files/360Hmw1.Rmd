#   Data Visualization and Google Trends on Three Different Measures from Turkey
##    1) Monthly Housing Data of Turkey over 2013-2020

This measure’s data set consists of monthly reported values of number of houses sold in Turkey. The data is taken between 2013 and 2020, however since the year 2020 has not ended yet, unfortunately, the last observation was September 2020. Aside from monthly observations, the number of houses sold were separated to cities where the house sold was located. More information about the data can be found in the [TUIK web-site source](https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Kategori/GetKategori?p=Insaat-ve-Konut-116). 

Since there were numbers for every city in Turkey, the data was huge and to narrow it down “Total Number of Houses Sold in Turkey” is selected as the measure. After the necessary manipulations, the dataset that include number of monthly sold houses in Ankara, İstanbul and Turkey total were obtained. If we look at the head of this data frame,


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	message = FALSE,
	warning = FALSE,
	include = FALSE
)
##Necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
library(RColorBrewer)

##Datasets needed for the first measure
konut = read_xls("C:/Users/ŞAHİN ÇETİN/Desktop/konut.xls")
satilik = read.csv("C:/Users/ŞAHİN ÇETİN/Desktop/satilik.csv")
emlak = read.csv("C:/Users/ŞAHİN ÇETİN/Desktop/Emlak.csv")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
##necessary manipulations of first measure set
konut = konut[1:85,]
konut = data.frame(konut)
konut = konut %>% select_if(~!all(is.na(.)))
konut = konut[-2,]
konut = konut[,-c(seq(14, 98, by = 13), 102:105)]
years = c(rep("2013",12), rep("2014",12), rep("2015",12), rep("2016",12),
          rep("2017",12), rep("2018",12), rep("2019",12), rep("2020",9))
konut[1, 2:94] = years
colnames(konut)[1] = "Cities"
konut = konut %>% filter(is.na(Cities) | Cities == "Türkiye" | Cities == "Ankara" | Cities == "İstanbul")
konut.son = data.frame(Loc=NA, Year=NA, Month=NA, Sold=NA)

for(i in 3:5){
  for(j in 2:94){
    konut.son = rbind(konut.son, c(konut$Cities[i], konut[1,j], konut[2,j], konut[i,j]))
  }
}
konut.son = konut.son[-1,]
konut.son = konut.son %>% mutate(Month = match(substr(Month, 1, 3), month.abb))
konut.son = konut.son %>% mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year))
konut.son = konut.son %>% mutate(Date = ymd(paste(Year, Month, 15)))
konut.son = konut.son %>% mutate(Sold = as.numeric(Sold))
konut.son = konut.son[,-c(2:3)]

##dates that may be needed for trend data of both measure sets
dates = ymd(paste(row.names(satilik)[2:204], "-15"),"%Y-%m-%d")
dates = dates[-204]

##trend data manipulation function for the first two measures trends
trendFolder = function(x, year){
  x = as.data.frame(x[-1,])
  x = x%>%mutate(Date = dates)
  colnames(x)[1] = "SearchVolume"
  x = x %>% filter(year(Date)>=year)
  x = x %>% filter(Date < "2020-10-15")
  x = x %>% mutate(SearchVolume = as.numeric(SearchVolume))
  return(x)
}

##trend data manipulation of first measure
satilik = trendFolder(satilik, 2013)
emlak = trendFolder(emlak, 2013)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
head(konut.son)
```



It can be seen that there is a date column that shows every month’s 15th day. Normally, these values are collected for the whole month and what is meant by 15-01-2013 is the time horizon January 2013 as a month. This date is added since it is easier to plot with the full date and the interpretation of the end or the beginning of the month can be misleading. Moreover, although the aim is to visualize Turkey as a whole, İstanbul and Ankara were taken as separate locations to see the extent of how the trends in these megacities are in relation to Turkey. 

If we plot all the observations with respect to time,

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ggplot(konut.son, aes(x=Date, y=Sold)) +
  geom_line(size = 1, aes(color= Loc, group=Loc)) +
  labs(title = "Number of Houses Sold in Turkey over 2013-2020 observed Monthly", 
       x = "Date",
       y = "Houses Sold") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 months") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

We can see that there are oscillations throughout the time. The general trend seems to be somewhat increasing. It can also be seen that the trends in İstanbul and Ankara show a great deal of parallel to Turkey. In fact, the spikes in these cities are clearer to be understood than Turkey.  In most of the past years, there can be seen an increase in number of houses sold in autumn months that eventually resulted in a greater spike in December. However, followed by this increase there seems sudden decreases in the number of houses sold in January. This pattern seems to be repeating over 2013 till 2019 with changing amplitudes. These can be results of housing interests, credits or regulations that start in at the beginning of each year. Apart from these two cities, there also can be detected sharp spikes in spring and summer in Turkey.  This may be due to the fact that people preferring to buy summer houses for vocational purposes in cities with beaches. The fact that this trend was not seen in İstanbul and Ankara is supporting this hypothesis, thought it needs further investigation.

There are more ups and downs in much more greater amplitudes in 2019 and 2020.  Although the same trends are existent, judging from the graph there are more houses sold in 2019. In 2020, there seems a great decrease followed by greater increase in the number of houses sold. In the last few years, it is always said that “housing is one of the main areas of Turkish economy where many transactions occur”. The numbers are evidence to this. The sudden crash of the market can easily be explained by the global pandemic and lockdowns in country. There are also the same movements in Ankara and İstanbul.

If we observe the year by year histograms each constitute of 12 observations,

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ggplot(konut.son%>%filter(Loc == "Türkiye"), aes(x=Sold)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), colour="orange", fill="lightyellow", bins = 30)+ 
  geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="lightpink", colour="darkorange") +
  labs(title = "Year by Year Histograms of Number of Houses Sold in Turkey over 2013-2020 observed Monthly", 
       x = "Number of Houses Sold in a Month",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~year(Date), ncol=3)
```

It can be seen that in the first few years the distribution can more easily be fitted into the normal distribution. As the time has passed, the distributions seem to be shifted to the right, showing the increasing trend in number of houses sold. In the past two years, the number range has become wider and the fitting curve is almost flat. This is also in line with the sudden increases and decreases in the number. 

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ggplot(konut.son%>%filter(Loc == "Türkiye"), aes(x=Date, y=Sold, group=year(Date))) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill= factor(year(Date)))) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "BuPu", name = "Years") +
  labs(title = "Boxplots of Number of Houses Sold in Turkey over 2013-2020 Year by Year", 
       x = "Year Dates",
       y = "Number of Houses Sold") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
  
```

With the boxplot, the story behind the numbers can be seen more clearly. It is obvious that until 2018, there has been a slightly increasing trend in the housing market. However, in the last three years the numbers have become more spread and the increasing trend seems to come to an end. It is only in this year that the market have recovered from that point. Still, the wide range of numbers point to an instability in the market and the reasons behind this phenomena can further be investigated. 

As Google Trends search keywords “satılık” and “emlak” is selected. “Satılık” means “for sale” in Turkish. It is a widely used word in internet searches when people are looking for home. “Emlak” means “real estate agency”.  The data provided by Google Trends for this keyword was also monthly. When the data is plotted in boxplot,

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ggplot(satilik, aes(x=Date, y=SearchVolume, group=year(Date))) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill= factor(year(Date)))) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "BuPu", name = "Years") +
  labs(title = "Boxplots of Search Volumes of <Satılık> in Turkey over 2013-2020 Year by Year", 
       x = "Year Dates",
       y = "Search Volumes") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
  
```

It can be easily observed that the search volume of the word “satılık” is positively correlated with the number of houses sold in Turkey. The movements and changes in range are quite alike. It is only sometimes that the changes in the volume are more obvious than the changes in number of houses sold. This may be due to the fact that “for sale” keyword is used for many other assets such as cars, land etc. So this keyword may represent a more general area of transactions in Turkey economy.

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ggplot(emlak, aes(x=Date, y=SearchVolume, group=year(Date))) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill= factor(year(Date)))) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "BuPu", name = "Years") +
  labs(title = "Boxplots of Search Volumes of <Emlak> in Turkey over 2013-2020 Year by Year", 
       x = "Year Dates",
       y = "Search Volumes") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
  

```

The keyword “emlak” does not seem to show much correlation to the number of houses sold in Turkey over years. In fact, there seems an ever-going decrease in the search volume that continued with movements similar to the last years’ movements in the number of houses sold. The decreasing trend is mysterious and it might be due to the changing preferences of people buying houses since nowadays the web-sites and applications serving for this purpose are used widely.


##    2) Monthly Number of Tourists visiting Turkey over 2013-2020

This measure’s dataset consists of monthly reported values of total number of tourists coming to Turkey in the specified month. The data is collected over the years 2012-2020. The details and preference of chosen date are the same as the first measure set. The data is taken from the TUIK web-site source.

```{r include=FALSE}
##Datasets needed for the second measure
turist = read_xls("C:/Users/ŞAHİN ÇETİN/Desktop/turist.xls")
antalya = read.csv("C:/Users/ŞAHİN ÇETİN/Desktop/Antalya.csv")
bodrum = read.csv("C:/Users/ŞAHİN ÇETİN/Desktop/Bodrum.csv")
cesme = read.csv("C:/Users/ŞAHİN ÇETİN/Desktop/Cesme.csv")

##necessary manipulations of second measure set
cellSeq = seq(3, 27, by = 3)
turist.son = data.frame(Year=NA, Month=NA, Tourists=NA)
for(i in cellSeq){
  for(j in 1:12){
    turist.son = rbind(turist.son, c((2011 + (i/3)), month.abb[j], as.integer(turist[j+5, i])))
  }
}

turist.son = turist.son[-1,]
turist.son = turist.son[-c(106:108),]
turist.son$Tourists[is.na(turist.son$Tourists)] = 0
turist.son = turist.son %>% mutate(Date = ymd(paste(Year, Month, 15)))
turist.son = turist.son %>% mutate(Tourists = as.numeric(Tourists))
turist.son = turist.son %>% mutate(Month = match(Month, month.abb))

##trend data manipulation of second measure
antalya = trendFolder(antalya, 2012) %>% mutate(Loc = "Antalya")
bodrum = trendFolder(bodrum, 2012) %>% mutate(Loc = "Bodrum")
cesme = trendFolder(cesme, 2012) %>% mutate(Loc = "Cesme")
totalCities = rbind(antalya, bodrum, cesme)

```

With the necessary manipulations the head of the data frame,

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
head(turist.son)
```

If we plot the observations with respect to time,

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ggplot(turist.son, aes(x=Date, y=Tourists)) +
  geom_line(color = "purple", size = 1, aes(group=1)) +
  labs(title = "Number of Tourist Visits to Turkey over 2012-2020 observed Monthly", 
       x = "Date",
       y = "Number of Tourists Visited") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 months") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

It can easily be seen that there is a high extent of seasonality in the data. There are more tourists coming in the summer months and Turkey is the least attractive for the tourists in winter months. This kind of pattern is just like the average temperatures seen in Turkey. As a result, it can be claimed that what makes Turkey a tourist attraction can be milder temperatures, fresh air and summer vibes around the coastlines. There is also an increasing trend that is broken by the year 2016. This exception to the rule might be because of the tense Turkey and Russian diplomatic relations and the air the failed coup attempt in July 20016 created in Turkey. The crash followed by a weak increase in 2020 is surely the result of lockdown and pandemic. 

To look at the trends within years we can plot each year by a different line with respect to months,

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ggplot(turist.son, aes(x=Month, y=Tourists)) +
  geom_line(size = 1, aes(color=Year, group=Year)) +
  labs(title = "Number of Tourist Visits to Turkey observed Monthly in Years", 
       x = "Months",
       y = "Number of Tourists Visited") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:12)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

This plot shows that in the last years, the patterns between months have become more and more profound. Moreover, judging from the first two months the year 2020 have signaled the higher tourists coming. It can also be seen that year 2016 started as a normal year but starting from April the numbers did not grow as much as can be expected, this was when the diplomatic relations were the tensest. Consequently, that suggests the earlier idea of why the numbers have dropped in 2016.

If we draw histograms,

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ggplot(turist.son, aes(x=Tourists)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), colour="blue", fill="lightblue")+ 
  geom_density(alpha=.4, fill="purple", colour="black") + theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Year by Year Histograms of Tourists Visits to Turkey over 2012-2020 observed Monthly", 
       x = "Number of Tourists coming to Turkey in a Month",
       y = "Density") +
  facet_wrap(~year(Date), ncol=3)
```

The monthly number of coming tourists are very spread throughout the months in almost all years. As the years go by, it seems that the bins have slightly shifted to right indicating an increase in most of the months.

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ggplot(turist.son, aes(x=Date, y=Tourists, group=year(Date))) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill= factor(year(Date)))) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuOr", name = "Years") +
  labs(title = "Boxplots of Tourist Visits to Turkey over 2012-2020 Year by Year", 
       x = "Year Dates",
       y = "Number of Tourists Visited") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

By drawing the box-plots, the previous results can be drawn.  If we draw the boxplots of monthly search volumes of some of the famous holiday resorts in Turkey such as Antalya, Bodrum and Çeşme;

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ggplot(totalCities, aes(x=Date, y=SearchVolume, group=year(Date))) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill= factor(year(Date)))) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuOr", name = "Years") +
  labs(title = "Boxplots of Search Volumes of various Holiday Resorts in Turkey over 2012-2020 Year by Year", 
       x = "Year Dates",
       y = "Search Volumes") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~Loc, ncol=3)
```

It can be seen from these graphs that despite all other things, Antalya is still more famous and known more widely than the other two important holiday locations. Moreover, the changes in number of tourists can be more easily seen in the changes of search volume of Antalya throughout the time. In addition to these, the search volume of “Çeşme” is wider than the other two locations. This may indicate a pattern where the interest in the city changes substantially over time with seasons.
